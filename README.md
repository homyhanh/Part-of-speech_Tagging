# Part-of-speech_Tagging
Part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging) is the task of tagging a word in a text with its part of speech. A part of speech is a category of words with similar grammatical properties. 

This notebook contains code for Transformation Based Learning that can tag POS in an English sentence.

Example

| John | lives | in | London | . |
|------|-------|------|-------|-------|
| NNP | VBZ | IN | NNP | . | 

All sentences are manually labeled based on the Penn Treebank tagset.
